title: About
---

I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Virginia (UVA), where I have been conducting research under the guidance of [Dr. Matthew Dwyer](https://matthewbdwyer.github.io/) and collaborating with [Dr. Sebastian Elbaum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Elbaum). Since August 2019, I have been proudly affiliated with the [Laboratory for Engineering Safe Software (LESS)](https://less-lab-uva.github.io/) lab at UVA.


My research is focused on enhancing automated software testing and verification for safety-critical systems. I have proposed techniques that primarily rely on static/dynamic program analyses, machine/deep learning, fault-based testing to evaluate developer-written test suites, identify their limitations, and leverage those limitations to improve their quality, specifically in terms of their ability to detect faults.


Before pursuing my PhD, I obtained an undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Engineering from [Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET)](https://eee.buet.ac.bd/) in 2016. Following this, I worked as a software development engineer at [REVE Systems](https://www.revesoft.com) from 2016 to 2019, gaining invaluable industry experience.

Overall, I am very hopeful that my academic and professional background, coupled with my research contributions, will enable me to make a meaningful impact in the field of automated software testing and verification.
