### Hello!

I am a final-year Ph.D. candidate at the University of Virginia (UVA). I am a member of the UVA [LESS](https://less-lab-uva.github.io/) lab, supervised by [Dr. Matthew Dwyer](https://matthewbdwyer.github.io/). My research interests lie at the intersection of Software Engineering and Machine Learning. I leverage program analysis and AI/ML techniques to enhance the cost-effectiveness of various software engineering tasks, including testing, debugging, and program repair. For more details, please see my [CV]({{'/'|relative_url}}assets/CV/CV.pdf).
