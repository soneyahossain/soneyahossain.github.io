title: About
---

I am a 5th-year PhD candidate in Computer Science at the University of Virginia (UVA), where I am advised by [Dr. Matthew Dwyer](https://matthewbdwyer.github.io/). I am a member of the UVA [LESS](https://less-lab-uva.github.io/) lab.  

My research interests lie in software testing, automated program repair, and the application of AI/ML in Software Engineering. I received my master's in Computer Science from UVA and my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Engineering from [BUET](https://eee.buet.ac.bd/). 

For more details, please find my [CV]({{'/'|relative_url}}assets/CV/CV.pdf).
