<p style="color:#ff6600; font-weight:bold; font-size:1.1em;">I am an incoming Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the University of Texas at Dallas, starting Fall 2025.</p>

I recently earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Virginia, where I was advised by [Dr. Matthew Dwyer](https://matthewbdwyer.github.io/). I use artificial intelligence to automate and improve the effectiveness of various software engineering tasksâ€”such as testing, debugging, and program repairâ€”making software more reliable and development more efficient. My work has been published in top-tier venues (e.g., ICSE, FSE, NeurIPS) and integrated into tools used by industry leaders like AWS and Lockheed Martin. More details on my [CV]({{'/'|relative_url}}assets/CV/CV.pdf).

<p style="color:#ff6600; font-weight:bold; font-size:1.1em;">
ðŸŒŸ I am currently recruiting Ph.D. students interested in AI for Software Engineering. If you're passionate about research at this intersection, feel free to reach outâ€”especially after reading some of my recent papers and thinking about ideas or extensions you'd be excited to explore.
